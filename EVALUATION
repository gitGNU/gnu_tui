Open questions from the author of TUI regarding the evaluation process
======================================================================

General
-------
Do i have to register TUI already as a new project as savanah.org? 
If so, gnu or nongnu?

I do have some variables not following the coding standard, but you (the homepage) also says to not rewrite.
So, may the current stay the same (as is), but just new variables have to follow the guideline?


Security
--------
Code injection:
Without ever (previous to this eval process) having read into anything about such a thing, i've tried to come up with something
that protects from malicious code, but still allows most basic/common shell usages as that is part of its requirement.
Due to the lack of professional background, specially on this topic, 
i'll need help to improve this protection and keep up the required functionality.

I did my best and will continue to do so, but i need to know what.


Similarities
------------
While GNU paralell is doing paralell tasks on different computers, 
tui-bgjob-mgr also handles a job queue but only on the machine it is executed.
As soon the user is in a GUI environment, he can use tui-bgjob-mgr to watch each of the running background tasks within their own terminal windows.
