# Simplified design:
#
#	BORDER_RIGHT will be mirrored from BORDER_LEFT
#	Set it manualy if it needs to be escaped.
#
	BORDER_LEFT="\\\./"
	BORDER_RIGHT="\\\./"
#
#	tui-header will use TUI_BACKGROUND as background color,
#	and TUI_FOREGROUND as font color.
#
#	tui-title will use inverted colors
#
	TUI_BACKGROUND="$TUI_COLOR_BG_YELLOW"
	TUI_FOREGROUND="$TUI_COLOR_FG_BLACK"
