			If a NEW_EXTENSION is provided, it will be replacing EXT (if exists).
			If BASENAME with either the existing EXT or the NEW_EXTENSION already exists, a number will be inserted before the file its new/old EXT.
			If BASENAME has neither an old EXT nor a NEW_EXTENSION, the number will become its extension.
			The number will be increased until the generated filename does not exist yet.
