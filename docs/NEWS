Releasing TUI 0.8.9-GNU-RC16, which now has been stripped off no longer used files.
Basicly, this release contains only the changes/tasks from https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?13746#comment2

As stated in some previous release notes 'tui' was renamed back to 'tui-browser'.
The symlink provided for an easier moving is now removed.

With the final big change on the help-screen of all the tui-<command>'s the old manpages are now merged into the current help screens,
this only means that the new manpages will be generated from the current help screen of the current command.

With the faith that these updates will help to pass the GNU evaluation, 
the mandatory upcoming GNU TUI 0.9.0 will then contain the updated URL
when it is hosted on http://www.gnu.org/software/tui

Then, i will take a little break.
Afterwich the hughe updates of tui-browser and tui-conf-editor will follow.
Meanwhile, i'll be working on tui-str-key, and extract some functions of tui-list.

----------
Configure and learn about TUI using 'tuirc'.

I want to keep the 'docs' dynamic.
Even as the initial texinfo file is accomplished, samples for all commands are still on the task list.
Some are already available.

See either 'tuirc html' or 'tuirc info' for general information on the usage of TUI.
See 'tuirc samples' for some more detailed and practical instructions.


2015.07.13
----------
Fixed some seriously (only visual) annoying issues upon first usage.


2015.07.11
----------
The new installation method is using the automake tools

	./configure && make && sudo make install)

for a better alignment with install procedure of other GNU/Linux projects.
