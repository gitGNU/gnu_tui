----------
Configure and learn about TUI using 'tuirc'.

I want to keep the 'docs' dynamic.
Even as the initial texinfo file is accomplished, samples for all commands are still on the task list.
Some are already available.

See either 'tuirc html' or 'tuirc info' for general information on the usage of TUI.
See 'tuirc samples' for some more detailed and practical instructions.

Fixed some seriously (only visual) annoying issues upon first usage.


2015.07.11
----------
The new installation method is using the automake tools

	./configure && make && sudo make install)

for a better alignment with install procedure of other GNU/Linux projects.
