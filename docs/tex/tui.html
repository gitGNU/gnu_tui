<p>This manual is for TUI (version 0.9.0, 2015.12.05).
</p>
<p>TUI is a command based Text User Interface framework for scripts.
</p>
<p>Although it requires BASH to be installed, the commands can be called from other SHELLS as well.
But be aware of their differences, such as string formatting and possible exit codes as examples.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction to TUI</h2>
<p><i>TUI is a bash framework to write scripts with a Text User Interface.</i>
</p>
<a name="Idea"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.1 Idea</h3>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, everything is about presenting. There are many tasks that can be faster accomplished using a script rather than writing an application for it as others require to use it.
This said, it is known many end-users don&rsquo;t like the terminal screen. That is usually because the commands in terminals have their output not very well structured, usually just text-by-text-by-newline-by-text.
This is if you need/want/have to provide scripts for users to use, and make it (a little) easier for them to &rsquo;read&rsquo; the terminal, without to have to write &rsquo;presentation&rsquo; handlers.
Thus user.conf in ~/.config/tui provides variables that may be used for any script that sources tui, same goes for apps.conf, which will provide EDITOR, BROWSER, FILEMGR, TERMINAL with your set favorite applications.
Now in the combination with tui-edit, you don&rsquo;t even need to source tuirc to have tui-edit open the given filename with your favorite editor.
</p>

<a name="What-is-TUI_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 What is TUI?</h4>
<p>It is a command based framework which wraps the task (executed command name represents task or 
description) into an adaptive Text User Interface (TUI).
It is a framework to be used in the shell or shell scripts, though the usage of scripts is recommended 
to preserve the interface feeling.
</p>
<p>It was the core display part of another script-dream I have, and it took me almost 2.5 years 
until i figured that extracting all these displaying functions, provide its very own project.
TUI was born, a command based framework to give scripts an interface like feeling.
</p>
<p>This said, when executed alone, a single tui-&lt;command&gt;, it doesn&rsquo;t look that much like an interface.
However, as soon you append a few tui-print after another or use tui-printfile to print a small text file to
the screen, you will feel the difference.
</p>
<a name="Why-TUI_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Why TUI?</h4>
<p>Many script authors write their collection of code helpers, display features or task assistants.
As such functions, they have to copy them to each of the scripts, 
and manually maintain and adjust the function inside that script, 
or update all those scripts just to be sure that function is updated.
</p>
<p>TUI jumps in here, providing a 3-Way-Interface between the Author of a script, 
the System (and its installed software) and the User who is executing it.
</p>
<a name="What-TUI-is-about"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 What TUI is about</h4>
<p>In fact, TUI is tui!
</p>
<p>&rsquo;tui&rsquo; is meant to make a directory a simple but highly configurable script menu, and display its 
sub-directories as sections and browse among the tree structure, with its entrance point as root.
All the other commands, are merely the code helpers, display tools, list library, variable providers,
gathered as commands for easy availability, so you can access them straight forward like any command 
in your scripts.
</p>
<p>You as the author of the script, don&rsquo;t have to worry about software the user has installed, 
instead you call: tui-edit, tui-filemgr, tui-web or tui-terminal (tui-terminal is GUI only), 
or which distribution the user is using, simply call tui-install to cover package manager 
installations from *BSD, Debian over Fedora/Red-Hat to Trisquel.
</p>

<p>It brings together the best of two worlds, the power of the console and the convenience of a graphical environment.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Getting the code</h3>
<p>It is recommended by FHS (http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#USRSRCSOURCECODE) to save source code in /usr/src.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    su

    cd tui

<h3 class="section">2.2 A basic installation procedure looks like:</h3>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    ./configure --prefix=/
    make
    make install
</pre></div>

<p>By default this will install TUI using the default prefix /usr/local, so the binaries will be available in PREFIX/bin.
</p>
<a name="Uninstall"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Configuration</h2>
<p>Is done either by the (End-)User, the applications installed and the system the user is using.
Default themes are &rsquo;default&rsquo; for the user, and &rsquo;default-red&rsquo; for root.
</p>
<p>First and for the most, you can change the theme.
A theme defines the left and right border, the font and background color of tui-header and tui-title,
as well as the input character for tui-select.
</p>
<p>Application invokes by either one of tui-edit, tui-filemgr, tui-web or tui-terminal which will search through
a list of known applications, diverted by cli or gui abilities if the default applications are not found.
If you have WINE installed, it may happened that &rsquo;notepad&rsquo; is started as editor rather than &rsquo;scribes&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If your favorite application is missing on its list, please contact the author of TUI to append it/them.
</p>
<p>Calling
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    tuirc config

<p>will bring up a screen to select which conf file to edit.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Apps / <small>$TUI_FILE_USER_CONF</small></h3>
<p>Upon first call, you will probably see the values listed as variable names with a &rsquo;$&rsquo;-prefix.
This setting will use the system defaults set in /etc/tui/apps.conf.
If you are calling the above command as root, you will edit the system defaults, and not the user preferences.
CURLWGET will be &rsquo;curl&rsquo; or &rsquo;wget&rsquo; if found, if neither is found, tui-download will ask to install either one.
</p>
<a name="Loadlist"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Loadlist</h3>
<p>Can only be edited, but should not be changed or expanded.
This file defines the order in which the user configuration files are read.
You may add custom entries, but be aware these functions or values will not be available if you share your scripts using them.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Settings / <small>$TUI_FILE_USER_SETTINGS</small></h3>
<p>Here, the behavior or default values for tui-commands is defined.

<p>This is the heart of TUI, as it provides the core functionality to display everything TUI will display.
But usually you will use it to update the current printed line of the previous/initial call of tui-printline.
</p>
<p>It handles up to three (3) quoted strings, printing the first one on the left side.
If there are 2 strings passed, the 2nd will be on the right side.
If there are 3 strings passed, the 2nd will be in the center, and the 3rd on the right side.
</p>
<p>This said, <b>tui-printline</b> provides the core display functionality for all the other core display command&rsquo;s,
such as <b>tui-print</b>, <b>tui-header</b>,  <b>tui-title</b>,  <b>tui-printfile</b>, <b>tui-status</b> and  <b>tui-progress</b>.
</p>
<p>Only the 2 optical dividers,  <b>tui-header</b> and  <b>tui-title</b> are colored according to the set theme.
</p>
<p>Please see <b>tui-print</b> for a simple example.
</p>
<a name="tui_002dprint"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 tui-print</h4>
<p>Like its regular counterpart <b>echo</b>, but provides the same output alignment as tui-printline.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    tui-print    
    tui-print one
    tui-print one two
    tui-print one two three
</pre></div>

<p>Which would then output as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">    # |                                                                      | #
    # | one                                                                  | #
    # | one                                                              two | #
    # | one                             two                            three | #
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dheader"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.3 tui-header</h4>
<p>With its full line  background color, tui-header is meant - where applicable - as &rsquo;constant&rsquo; header/footer of a loop based script.
Or just as a one time application information header.
</p>
<a name="tui_002dtitle"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.4 tui-title</h4>
<p>Is using the inverted colors of tui-header, having only the inlay line with a background.
</p>
<p>tui-title handles the first string argument differently, as it centers it.
With any further string argument, it behaves like the others.
</p>

<a name="tui_002dlist"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.5 tui-list</h4>
<p>Is nice handy tool to print different kinds of list.
* no numbering
* Arabic numbering (regular)
* roman numbering (from 1 to 9999)
* alphabetic numbering
</p>
<p><b>Examples</b>
Lets see how a default call handles an array containing 3 strings
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	array=(&quot;Some value&quot; &quot;Another one&quot; &quot;Watch out&quot;)
	tui-list &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Looks like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | 1) Some value               2) Another one              3) Watch out | #
</pre></div>

<p>Lets keep the array, and just use the roman toggle (**-r**), which looks like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	array=(&quot;Some value&quot; &quot;Another one&quot; &quot;Watch out&quot; &quot;Some value&quot; &quot;Another one&quot; &quot;Watch out&quot;)
	tui-list -r &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
	# | I. Some value             II. Another one             III. Watch out | #
	# | IV. Some value              V. Another one             VI. Watch out | #
</pre></div>

<p>To print a list with only one column, or just two, simply use the number as an option.
The option <b>-1</b> is great for list with long entry strings.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	$ tui-list -1 &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
	# | Some value                                   | #
	# | Another one                                  | #
	# | Watch out                                    | #
</pre></div>


<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	$ tui-list -2r &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
	# | I. Some value                II. Another one | #
	# | III. Watch out                  IV. a fourth | #
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dprintfile"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.6 tui-printfile</h4>

<p>This command simply prints the content of a file within TUI borders.
</p>
<p>To print the content of a file, simply pass its name or full path as argument.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-printfile /etc/os-release 
</pre></div>

<p>As an Easter egg it also provides a typewriter mode, which accepts strings as well.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-printfile -t message_file.txt
	tui-printfile -t &quot;some string&quot;
	tui-printfile -d 0.5 &quot;Message string&quot; ~/message_file.txt &quot;Another string&quot; ...
</pre></div>

<p>One can even pipe output:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	echo &quot;$(uname -a)&quot; | tui-printfile -t
	# | Linux cyberdyne.ocean 4.1.2-2-ARCH #1 SMP PRE| #
	# | EMPT Wed Jul 15 08:30:32 UTC 2015 x86_64 GNU/| #
	# | Linux                                        | #
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dprogress"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.7 tui-progress</h4>
<p>A very powerful tool to display several kinds of different progress indications.
</p>
<p>From a single animated dash, simple numbering, numbering up to a max value,
and even a progress bar with additional percent display.
</p>
<p>Its default animation is an animated dash.
This setup allows to show an animation with an unknown maximum by either time or invokes.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	for entry in $list
	do 	tui-progress &quot;Working with:&quot; 	&quot;$entry&quot;
	done
</pre></div>

<p>Which will be seen as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Working with:                     entry                     [  |   ] | #
</pre></div>

<p>For a more professional look and feel, one needs also a bit more preparations:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	declare -a list
	list=$(ls)
	count=${#list[@]}
	tui-print &quot;Updating the file its timestamp&quot;
	tui-progress -r
	
	for file in &quot;${#list[@]}&quot;
	do 	tui-progress -m $count &quot;Working on file:&quot; 	&quot;$file&quot;
		touch &quot;$file&quot;
		sleep 0.3
	done
</pre></div>

<p>Which will be shown as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Working on file:                     file                     7 / 20 | #
</pre></div>

<p>Last but not least, the one view you do expect of a progress - a bar:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	cur=1
	max=87
	while [ $cur -le $max ]
	do	# Optionally, you could use/add '-l' to display the progress percentage.
		tui-progress -b -m $max -c $cur &quot;Working on XY...&quot;
		((cur++))
		echo &quot;&quot;
	done
</pre></div>

<p>Would output (each as a single line):
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Working on XY...     [                     ] | #
	# | Working on XY...     [=                    ] | #
	# | Working on XY...     [===                  ] | #
	# | Working on XY...     [====                 ] | #
	
	
	# | Working on XY...     [=          ][ 16.09% ] | #
	# | Working on XY...     [=====      ][ 45.97% ] | #
	# | Working on XY...     [========== ][ 98.85% ] | #
</pre></div>




<a name="tui_002dstatus"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.1.8 tui-status</h4>
<p>A nice and handy tool to display the exit code of the previous condition.
</p>
<p>Although thought to help to display either success or failure of a task, it provides much more.
</p>

<p>Lets display a simple check if a file exist:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	[ -f filename ]
	tui-status $? &quot;File exists&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>Which would output as either of the 2 lines:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | File exists                        [  â   ] | #
	# | File exists                        [  â   ] | #
</pre></div>

<p>It could also be used for wizard like scripts:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-yesno &quot;Do you want to do XY?&quot; &amp;&amp; ret=0 || ret=4
	if tui-status &quot;$ret&quot; &quot;Doing XY&quot;
	then	echo todo
	fi
</pre></div>
<p>Which would return the following output, depending on your answer:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Do you want to do XY? (y/n)                y | #
	# | Doing XY                            [  â  ] | #
	todo

	# | Do you want to do XY? (y/n)                n | #
	# | Doing XY                            [  Â»   ] | #
</pre></div>

<p>If you start another command which takes some time before it displays anything, you could use:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	 tui-status -r 2 &quot;Starting something&quot; ; sleep 4 &amp;&amp; tui-status $? &quot;Started something now...&quot;
</pre></div>



<a name="Interactive-Commands"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Interactive Commands</h3>
<p>Ever wanted to start an editor at a users computer, but he had not installed it?
</p>
<p>Do not worry, the interactive tools provide a solution for this, and more.
</p>
<a name="tui_002dyesno"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.1 tui-yesno</h4>
<p>One of the most used tools in TUI, a simple bool returning command showing a question to the user.
And easy for the coder to handle.
</p>
<p>But see for yourself:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-yesno &quot;Show grub defaults?&quot; &amp;&amp; cat /etc/default/grub
	
	if tui-yesno &quot;Show grub defaults?&quot;
	then	cat /etc/default/grub
	fi
	
	tui-yesno &quot;Continue (y) or close terminal window (n)?&quot; || exit 0
</pre></div>



<a name="tui_002ddownload"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.2 tui-download</h4>
<p>Has the user curl or wget installed, both or none?
Do not worry, this tool handles this, it selects the first command found (or set in the configuration) to download.
While it does show how much data it downloaded (filesize), it cant show a progress bar - this is in plan but very low priority.
</p>
<p>Basically one call it simply like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-download &quot;http://download.server.com/file.zip&quot;
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dedit"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.3 tui-edit</h4>
<p>So, you want the user to edit a file, but do not know which editor he has installed?
</p>
<p>Call tui-edit, it looks for default editors, if none is found, it searches a list of known ones, 
if none is found it asks the user to install one of the known ones.
</p>
<p>Usually, one simply uses:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-edit ./somedir/file.txt
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dfilemgr"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.4 tui-filemgr</h4>
<p>So, you want the user to see some file, but do not know which file manager he has installed?
</p>
<p>Call tui-filemgr, it looks for default file managers, if none is found, it searches a list of known ones, 
if none is found it asks the user to install one of the known ones.
</p>
<p>Usually, one simply uses:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-filemgr &quot;$HOME/projects/this&quot;
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dpress"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.5 tui-press</h4>
<p>Does what it says, asks the user to &rsquo;press enter to continue&rsquo;.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-press
</pre></div>

<p>Looks like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Press [ENTER] to continue     Press [ENTER] to continue | #
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dread"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.6 tui-read</h4>
<p>Well, it reads the user input
</p>
<p>Usually this is to get a string of a user, like either one of these:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	answer=$(tui-read &quot;What is your hometown?&quot;)
	tui-read &quot;What is your hometown?&quot; &gt; /tmp/answer
</pre></div>
<p>So you then can work with either the variable or the file.
</p>

<a name="tui_002dselect"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.7 tui-select</h4>
<p>Select an item from passed arguments.
If your &rsquo;read&rsquo; supports it, it wont require &rsquo;enter&rsquo; to select an item which its digit count is as long as the digit count of the arguments passed (ex:: item 10 of 99)
If you want to select item 1 out of 11, you will have to press &rsquo;enter&rsquo; though.
</p>
<p>By default, it prints up to 3 values per line and lets you select among it.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	choice=$(tui-select 1 2 3)
	tui-select 1 2 3 &gt; /tmp/choice
</pre></div>

<p>Either of these, look like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | 1) 1               2) 2                 3) 3 | #
	# | &gt; 2    
</pre></div>

<p>However, if you want a only a single column, or just two, you may pass <b>-1</b> or <b>-2</b>.
Specially for long menu name selection, this can be a nice trick:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	choice=$(tui-select <b>-1</b> 1 2 3)
</pre></div>
<p>Will look like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | 1) 1                                         | #
	# | 2) 2                                         | #
	# | 3) 3                                         | #
	# | &gt;	
</pre></div>

<p>Also there might be situation, specially if you are working with dynamically generated lists, that only 1 entry is available.
</p>
<p>You might auto select that single entry by:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	answer=$(tui-select -a &quot;I'm all alone!&quot;)
	echo $answer
</pre></div>



<a name="tui_002dterminal"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.8 tui-terminal</h4>
<p>Obviously this will only work in GUI mode and will open the selected/preferred terminal emulator.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-terminal &quot;tui-conf-editor $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs&quot;
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dwait"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.9 tui-wait</h4>
<p>Waits given time (s/m/h), counting down and showing optional message.
This is good to indicate passed times, in case of a timeout or planned delay.
</p>
<p>One could be crazy and wait several hours:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-wait 5h &quot;I need to clean up my desktop icons!&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>Showing the full countdown:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | I need to clean up my desktop icons!                         4:59:58 | #
</pre></div>

<p>Or some more practical delay between an attempt:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-wait 5m &quot;Could not reach host, trying again in:&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>Showing the full countdown:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Could not reach host, trying again in:                          4:58 | #
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dweb"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.2.10 tui-web</h4>
<p>Not everyone might have Icecat or Midori installed, tui-web will search for installed web browser and open the passed URL in the first it finds.
</p>
<p>If none is found, it asks the user to either install one from the list, or to manualy type the name of the browser (s)he uses.
Just like tui-edit, tui-filemgr, and tui-terminal.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-web &quot;http://www.gnu.org&quot;
</pre></div>

</p>
<a name="tui_002dbol_002ddir"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 tui-bol-dir</h4>
<p>Returns true if passed dir was found or could be created.
If verbose mode is enabled, it shows tui-status.
</p>
<p>As in:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bol-dir -v bin
</pre></div>
<p>Prints output as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Found: bin                          [  â   ] | #
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise for a path that can be created:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bol-dir -v tmp
</pre></div>
<p>Prints output as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Created: tmp                        [  â   ] | #
</pre></div>

<p>And a path that can not be created (due to missing rights):
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bol-dir -v /a/new/path  || exit 1
</pre></div>
<p>Prints output as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Created: /a/new/path                [  â   ] | #
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dbol_002dgui"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 tui-bol-gui</h4>
<p>Returns true if the user is in GUI mode.
Returns DE name if verbose.
</p>
<p>A basic example could be:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	if tui-bol-gui
	then	filezilla
	else	ftp
	fi
</pre></div>

<p>One could also display which DE the user is running:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-print &quot;Your GUI/DE is:&quot; &quot;$(tui-bol-gui -v)&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>Which outputs like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# | Your GUI/DE is:                      awesome | #
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dbol_002droot"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.3 tui-bol-root</h4>
<p>Returns true if user is root.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bol-root &amp;&amp; \
		echo &quot;You're root&quot; || \
		echo &quot;You're a regular user!&quot;
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dconf_002deditor"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.4 tui-conf-editor</h4>
<p>A basic tool to edit a conf file.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	su -c &quot;tui-conf-editor /etc/default/grub&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>This would let you edit the current settings of /etc/default/grub.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-conf-editor	-T &quot;Human Configurator&quot; --option var_gender --default male --values=&quot;male female&quot; \
			--option var_name --default &quot;$USER&quot; \
			--option var_age --default 0 --values=&quot;1-13 14-21 22-44 44-62 63-90 90+&quot; \
			--write-no-exist \
			/path/to/file
</pre></div>
<p>Would create a default config file, that will look like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	var_gender=male
	var_name=&lt;the users login name&gt;
	var_age=0
</pre></div>
<p>The user now can then change the values of these variables by selecting them from the menu, where he could leave the menu too.
In this example, the user can select between male and female upon selecting <b>var_gender</b>, likewise for <b>var_age</b>, but among those age-ranges.
For the <b>var_name</b> however, he must type a new name, since there are no values to select from.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-conf-editor	-T &quot;Human Configurator&quot; --option var_gender --default male --values=&quot;male female&quot; \
			--option var_name --default &quot;$USER&quot; \
			--option var_age --default 0 --values=&quot;1-13 14-21 22-44 44-62 63-90 90+&quot; \
			--write-no-exist \
			-q \
			/path/to/file
</pre></div>
<p>Would simply check each variable to be present, and if not, save it with available default value.
</p>
<a name="tui_002dconf_002dget"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.5 tui-conf-get</h4>
<p>Gets the value of a variable from a file.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	CFG=/etc/default/grub
	KEY=GRUB_TIMEOUT
	
	value=$(tui-conf-get $CFG $KEY)
	echo $value
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dconf_002dset"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.3.6 tui-conf-set</h4>
<p>Set the value of a variable in a file.
Similar as <b>tui-conf-get</b> but saves a value.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">	CFG=/etc/default/grub
	KEY=GRUB_TIMEOUT
	VAL=3
	
	tui-conf-get $CFG $KEY $VAL
</pre></div>

<p>It also provides a verbose mode:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-conf-get -v  $CFG $KEY $VAL
</pre></div>

<a name="tui_002dbgjob"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.5.1 tui-bgjob</h4>
<p>Executes a script in background.
</p>
<p>Prints first string while running, second when done.
</p>
<p>To start a script to run in background and print a message while running:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob &quot;/path/to/script&quot; &quot;Running script&quot; &quot;Ran Script&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>While &quot;Running script&quot; is shown while the script is running, 
the exit status of the script is show with the 2nd string &quot;Ran Script&quot; in the style of tui-status.
</p>
<p>While the default animation mode is the animated dash, if you are &rsquo;generating&rsquo; a (larger) file, you might want to display its size:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob -f &quot;/path/to/generated/file&quot; &quot;/path/to/script&quot; &quot;Running script&quot; &quot;Ran Script&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>If you have a specific filesize to expect, you may change to progress bar display by supplying the expected byte size:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob -f &quot;/path/to/generated/file&quot; -e 4294967296 &quot;/path/to/script&quot; &quot;Running script&quot; &quot;Ran Script&quot;

<a name="tui_002dbgjob_002dmgr"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.5.2 tui-bgjob-mgr</h4>
<p>Executes multiple scripts at once. 
</p>
<p>Lets you define how many scripts shall run simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Can run in quiet mode and return (as exit code) how many scripts were ended with success.
</p>
<p>The basic usage is plain convenience, execute all files in this folder (expecting them to be scripts!)
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob-mgr *
</pre></div>
<p>This will show &rsquo;progress&rsquo; of the working through all these scripts.
However, it will just show if a script is planed to, running or how it ended.
</p>

<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>Something of importance to know is the that the wait option (&quot;-w SECS&quot;) has influence 
on the interval it checks if scripts have completed.
</p>
<p>The shorter the interval, the faster scripts can be processed, but it should not be set lower than 1 sec for a longer period of time.
</p>
<p>The longer the interval, the more time the CPU has to work on its jobs.
</p>

<p>The interval should be set to at max 50% of the slowest job expected, and should be no lower than 1 sec.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Runs all KSH scripts with an interval of 5 minutes between visual (and actual working-) updates.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob-mgr -w 360 *.ksh
</pre></div>

<p>If you have just 3 or 4 scripts to monitor, you might like this in a GUI/(D)WM environment
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-bgjob-mgr -v window1.sh window2.sh window3.ksh script4.csh
</pre></div>


<p>However, when working with multiple scripts, it may occur than some scripts shall only be executed if some previous scripts were executed successfully.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	TASK=&quot;script1.sh script2.sh script3.sh&quot;	
	MAX=$(echo $TASK | wc -w)

	[ &quot;$RET&quot; -eq &quot;$MAX&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \
		./script4.sh
</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dinstall"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.5.3 tui-install</h4>
<p>Can be used to identify what distro the system is.
</p>
<p>Is meant to install dependencies that might be found in the distro its repository.
</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the different package managers used, 
it is not yet possible to capture each package managers its own verification within TUI,
so that output is (by default and for security) untouched.
</p>
<p>For scripts you share, it is recommend to leave the default handling as described here.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-install pluma
</pre></div>

<p>Could output on arch like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	# tui-install  pluma

<div class="example">

</pre></div>


<a name="tui_002dlog"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">4.5.4 tui-log</h4>
<p>A tool to manage/write your custom logfiles with ease.
</p>
<p>As most logfiles provides several basic information on the left side, tui-log has options for that.
</p>
<p>To create a custom logfile header, you could use:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	echo &quot;# Logfile for XY, created on DATE&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;/path/to/logfile.log&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>tui-log -e &quot;logfile.log&quot; &quot;# Logfile for XY, created on DATE&quot;
</p>
<p>Because, every writing to a logfile checks first if the current date is found in the logfile.
</p>
<p>If that is not the case, it first prints the current date before writing the passed message.
Like this basic usage example shows:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	rm logfile.log
	tui-log -t logfile.log &quot;Logfile created.&quot;
	cat logfile.log
	
	#### 2015-08-02 ####
	06:34:09 	 Logfile created.
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise for the other options, date (would be very repetitive, but anyway), time, pid, user ; alone or in any combination.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">	tui-log -up logfile.log &quot;What is my name and the pid&quot;
	cat logfile.log

	#### 2015-08-02 ####
	06:34:09 	 Logfile created.
	sea 3821 	 What is my name and the pid
</pre></div>

<a name="Original-Origin"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Original Origin</h4>
<p>Around 1995 i&rsquo;ve met the MSDOS command &rsquo;net&rsquo;, 
which allowed me to send messages to a friends computer in the like of: &rsquo;net send &lt;IP&gt; &quot;msg&quot;&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>That kind of usage feeling impressed me, to some extend, it was &rsquo;speech control&rsquo;, and i wanted to make something like that available.
Not literal &rsquo;speech control&rsquo; but allow &rsquo;words&rsquo; to form a &rsquo;command&rsquo; which then is executed.
</p>
<p>A bit later, a friend asked me if we wanted to try to write an interface for the console, but we failed badly because he was pushing for GUI actions too much, which text just doesnt allow that easily.
Sadly, my BATCH and QBASIC skills werent that trained, and beeing a teenager, i had other interests too, so that idea never got realized.
</p>
<p>Early 2000 those ideas, thoughts and goals lost their focus pretty quickly when i joined the army for some service.
</p>


<a name="First-year-of-GNU_002fLinux"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 First year of GNU/Linux</h4>
<p>Back in May 2011, i&rsquo;ve got annoyed by Windows 7 - actually by the laptop it was installed on, as it didnt have a GPU (graphic processor unit) to play games - eventually i figured to try GNU/Linux again, after like 16 ears.
As you are probaly aware, there is more than just one flavor of GNU/Linux. 
</p>
<p>There are more than just the mainstream &rsquo;brands&rsquo; (like: Debian, Fedora/RedHat, Gentoo, Slackware, etc) but there is also a wide range of DE and WM&rsquo;s.
So, still being a technical enthusiast, who likes to tinker around, break things and learn new things, i&rsquo;ve enjoyed the diversity of so many distributions (also known as: distro / distros).
</p>
<p>Anyway, so end of May 2011, when Fedora 15 (LoveLock) was just released, i &rsquo;joined&rsquo; GNU/Linux, as in, the distro hopping began.
</p>
<p>As i been &rsquo;at home&rsquo; among diffrent distros/de/wm combinations, i quickly figured, the most powerfull tool to get things done on any possibe combination, while giving me the power to maintain/change the tool even at init 1, was scripts.
</p>
<p>In the end, I ended up having tons of scripts doing almost the same, just for every different distro i had tried.
But all those scripts had something in common, they did the very same things (tweakings/installations) on different ways (apt-get, brewer, pacman, yum...) or with different paths set.
Oh boy did i start writing scripts, at first each script/task for its own distro, then i started to sort them in folders, but could no longer access them easily from anywhere of the terminal.
</p>

<a name="Getting-used-to-GNU_002fLinux-and-the-birth-of-_0027script_002dtools_0027"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Getting used to GNU/Linux and the birth of &rsquo;script-tools&rsquo;</h4>
<p>Due to that process of repeative installation and configuration of the system, i wanted to ease that task of writing scripts.
Seeing other scripts, the GNU/Linux loading text of the console, and the urge to simply some scripting tasks, i started to write some first functions.
</p>
<p>At some later time, that project was renamed several times, ending up with the name &rsquo;script-tools&rsquo;.
This said, you probably can imagine that &rsquo;TUI&rsquo; was just a very part of &rsquo;script-tools&rsquo;, 
which - due to several sub sections - had functions stored in external files, 
so all the scripts spread across different folders could just source those function-scripts, 
so i would not need to edit several files to apply a single char change.
</p>
<p>When i started to figure that i had several functions twice, with a slightly different name in another function-script, 
but doing the very same task, i thought avoidance might be the key.
</p>
<p>This was in 2014, 3 years after my joining to the GNU/Linux community, &rsquo;constantly&rsquo; working on that project,
so that project &rsquo;script-tools&rsquo; contained everything, from tweaking grub1 &amp; grub2, plymouth, signature generator, project manager (rpm, mock, kickstart/specs, git/sf, ftp, rpm repo, cron) to name a few...
</p>
<p>Now &rsquo;script-tools&rsquo; was already part of that idea, you could call it like &rsquo;st tweak grub 2 timeout 4&rsquo; or browse there by just calling &rsquo;st&rsquo;.
</p>
<a name="The-extraction-of-TUI"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 The extraction of TUI</h4>
<p>Those (not really) first functions where: sS, yesno, sE, sT and sH, representing the todays commands tui-status, tui-yesno, tui-print, tui-title and tui-header.
At first, i thought i might keep them as functions, due to the one time reading to the memory, it would be very fast afterwards.
Figured, having the display functions and the working functions mixed up, causes unneeded trouble and could be avoided by extracting the display fuctions as their own project &ndash; TUI.
</p>
<p>But then i thought of all the other shells i havent tried yet, but beeing aware that most of them work generally the same way,
i wanted to make TUI also available to them - to some extend.
Keeping TUI as plain BASH functions was no longer an option.
Providing these functions as scripts/commands while sharing the same variables was the next obvious and usable option.
</p>

<a name="Finalizing-TUI"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.5 Finalizing TUI</h4>

<p>Eventually, i thought it was done - besides of a few work-overs for one or two commands to improve usability, and therefor i thought i was ready to introduce TUI to GNU.
After deleting some commands, there were still over 46 commands to be worked on, their manpage, their wiki.md, their infotext and their helpscreens.
Preparing all the commands to be translateable was more of a mental challenge in regards of the count of the command, rather than the actual effort required.
But getting this alltogether, working as intended, took quite some time anyway.

<a name="About-the-Author"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.1.6 About the Author</h4>
<p>Simon Arjuna Erat has first met a computer at the age of 8, at his dad&rsquo;s cellar office with a Commodore64.
The first i remember about that computer is, that my dad was just changing the tape-drive with a 5.25&quot; soft-floppy.
</p>
<p>Allthough i was very much into optimizing my system by tweaking the autoexec.bat and config.sys,
i usualy just did it to gain more free memory over the 512k &rsquo;barrier&rsquo;, to play the games more fluently, 
as they required an incredible high amount of RAM... up to 8MB!
</p>
<p>Later in 1995, i&rsquo;ve had my hands on Slackware 3.0 and RedHat 2 or 3 (not RHEL, before Fedora).
</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2001 i was self-employed PC-Supporter helping private people as well as small- &amp; medium companies in and around my town.
In  between there was some army services, and afterwards i&rsquo;ve raised a security company with some friends, which went well until 2004,
where i went back to my origins, and created homepages and flyers for several bars, clubs, discotheques and other etablissements.
</p>
<p>Then finaly in 2011, i&rsquo;ve had enough of Windows and &rsquo;joined the GNU/Linux Community&rsquo;.
Providing my part to it, by realizing/writing an idea i&rsquo;ve had almost 20 years ago... TUI for scripts.

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means

<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<a name="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></a>
<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
