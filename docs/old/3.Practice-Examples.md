Furthermore, there is ##tui-status## which makes init-style status messages, which handles diffrent return values, best recomended to use with ##$?##.

	[ -f /../invalid ]
	tui-status $? "File found"
	
Will return the following line, where the 'x' is bold red.

	# | File found                                         [  âœ˜   ] | #

And preserve the passed return code, as it 'exit' with the same - '1' in this case.







While the command names should to be as natural language / self explaining / techicly correct as possible, there had to be some few compromises.
