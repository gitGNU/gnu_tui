"NAME\n"
"       GNU TUI - Text User Interface, framework for scripts\n"
"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       tui-<tab>\n"
"       source tuirc\n"
"       tuirc config\n"
"       tuirc theme default\n"
"       tuirc theme floating\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       An  easy  way  to give your scripts some bling bling is to use TUI, "
"which is an abrevihation for\n"
"       \"Text User Interface\".  Technicly, it is a framework of commands to "
"help you creating a (due  to\n"
"       the limits of scripts) line based text interface.\n"
"       All the commands start with the prefix tui- followed by either the "
"subsection, like bol-, conf-,\n"
"       str- or just the command its name/acronym/synonym.  Their names are "
"chosen to  represent  either\n"
"       their counterparts or to describe what it does. tui-printf beeing the "
"exception, as its original\n"
"       functionaly is now metaphoricly adapted for TUI.\n"
"\n"
"       It also helps to start the proper application like editor, file "
"manager or web  broswer,  so  it\n"
"       chooses  a GUI application if there is a GUI, and a console "
"application if there is none ($DESKÔÇÉ\n"
"       TOP_SESSION).\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       Please see their respective help or manpage information for their "
"options and syntax.\n"
"\n"
"USAGE\n"
"       It is thought for the use via ssh or telnet connections, to provide "
"the  enduser  an  interface.\n"
"       Or to style up scripts and make them more pleasent to the eye.\n"
"       While for the basic \"display\" task, one only needs one of these "
"four commands:\n"
"             * tui-header, to make the full line with a blue background and "
"white font (theme:default)\n"
"             * tui-title, to make inner area with a blue background and "
"white font (theme:default)\n"
"             * tui-echo, to make the full line with the terminal default "
"colors.\n"
"             * tui-printf, to make next tui-<command> \"overwrite\" the "
"current output.\n"
"       The biggest part of the TUI package however, are its additional "
"commands.\n"
"       If  your  shell supports tab-completion, type: tui- and press tab one "
"or two times to get a list\n"
"       of TUI its commands.  Otherwise you can see a list of the command by "
"typing: ls /usr/bin/tui-\\*\n"
"       Simply said, they should perform their task while producing output "
"with the same output-style as\n"
"       tui-echo.\n"
"       Please see their according helpscreen (tui-<cmd> -h) or its manpage.\n"
"\n"
"USAGE as TOOLS\n"
"       The tools can also be used to make your terminal usage safer...\n"
"            cmd=tui-echo\n"
"            for f in * ; do \\044cmd \"\\044f\" \"\\044{f:5:"
"\\044{#f}-15}\" ; done\n"
"\n"
"       then, when i like what i see, i simply type:\n"
"            cmd=mv\n"
"\n"
"       press arrow key up twice, and rerun:\n"
"            for f in * ; do \\044cmd \"\\044f\" \"\\044{f:5:"
"\\044{#f}-15}\" ; done\n"
"\n"
"       and have the files renamed as i needed to, with a simple and safe "
"compare of the two values.\n"
"\n"
"FILES\n"
"       These files are used as settings and user customization.\n"
"       Generaly  speaking, these are ment so the user configures the "
"\"endpoints\" (theme, applications),\n"
"       and the developer can focus on writing functions, and simply use  tui-"
"edit  instead  of  looking\n"
"       which text editor is installed, and wether or not the user is in "
"graphical interface.\n"
