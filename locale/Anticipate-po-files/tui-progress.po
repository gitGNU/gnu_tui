"Usage: \t$ME [options] [\\\"Message\\\"]\n"
"\n"
"Where options are:\n"
"\t-h(elp) \t\tThis screen\n"
"\t-b(ar)\t\t\tEnables the \\\"bar\\\" mode (minimal)\n"
"\t-B(ar)\t        VAL     Changes the bar-symbol to VAL\n"
"\t-c(urrent)\tVAL\tRequired for bar-mode\n"
"\t-C(learline)\t\tClear the line before print a new value, recommended if "
"you pass multiple files\n"
"\t-m(ax)\t\tVAL\tIf provided, changes progress-string output to \\"
"\"calculated-num / VAL \\\"\n"
"\t-l(ong)\t\t\tPrints more info when in bar mode.\n"
"\t-i(dent)\tVAL\tVAL is used as part of tempfile name tui-progress use, if "
"used in multiple instances\n"
"\t\t\t\tShould be provided if used with -m\n"
"\t-r(eset)\t\tResets the tempfile, should be used before one is passing \n"
"\n"
"When called without options, it simply displays a rotating dash (-/|\\) on "
"the right side.\n"
"When called with option \\\"-m NUM\\\" it increments the number found in the "
"tempfile, and showing [ incr/NUM ], before using this mode, you should reset "
"the tempfile (-r), or use a specific tempfile identifier (-i STRING_ID).\n"
"You can overwrite the requirement for a tempfile, if you pass \\\"-c NUM\\"
"\".\n"
"When called with \\\"-b\\\", the options \\\"-m NUM\\\" and \\\"-c NUM\\\" "
"are both required.\n"
